Python Programming Language

## Overview
Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.

### Some of Python's notable features:
* Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read.
* Is an easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get your program working. This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.
* Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.
* Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.
* Is easily extended by adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.
* Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.
* Runs anywhere, including `Mac OS X`, `Windows`, `Linux`, and `Unix`, with unofficial builds also available for `Android` and `iOS`.
* Is free software in two senses. It doesn't cost anything to download or use Python, or to include it in your application. Python can also be freely modified and re-distributed because while the language is copyrighted it's available under an open-source license.

### Some programming-language features of Python are:
* A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.
* Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple inheritances.
* Code can be grouped into modules and packages.
* The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.
* Data types are strongly and dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception to be raised, so errors are caught sooner.
* Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and list comprehensions.
* Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code.

## Downloading Python
* install the Python 3 interpreter on your computer. This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming. Mac and Linux distributions may include an outdated version of Python (Python 2), but you should install an updated one (Python 3).*

On many systems Python comes pre-installed, you can try running the python command to start the Python interpreter to check and see if it is already installed. On windows you can try the py command which is a launcher which is more likely to work. If it is installed you will see a response which will include the version number, for example:

If you don't see this, you will need to install Python on your system.

If the version number is Python 2.x.y (where x and y are any number) you are using Python 2 which is no longer supported and is not a good choice for development. You can try running python3 to see if there is also a Python 3.x.y version installed, if not you'll want to install the latest version of Python.

If you do not have Python installed or need a newer version you can go to:
